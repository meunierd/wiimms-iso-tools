wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 1.7.9-1
 - Bug fix (thanx to fig2k4): Special characters in FST file names with code
   >127 will now be translated into UTF-8 to list and create files correct.
 - New option for "wwt LIST": --fragments: Print fragments and a ratio instead
   of the region info. A summary line is printed too.
 - New command: wwt LIST-F|LF: Short cut for "wwt LIST --fragments"
 - Option --sort=fragments sort some listings by the number of wbfs fragments.
 - Option --fast is ignored and will be removed in the near future.
   Please don't use --fast any longer.
 - New option: --copy-gc: If extracting a GameCube disc image, don't extract
   the real files to '/files/...'. Instead create a copy of the source image
   and store it as 'game.iso'. If the source image have the correct format and
   option --no-link is not set, try a hard link first.
 - Option --neek replaces the old --sneek, but --sneek is also accepted.
   Option --neek includes now option --copy-gc.
 - "wit extract --neek --dest %i": Extract like DiscEx (but faster!).
   The only change is for GameCube discs because of implied --copy-gc.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
