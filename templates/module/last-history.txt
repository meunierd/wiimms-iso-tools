wit v1.01a r1245 - 2010-06-20

 - CISO support: The new options --chunk-mode, --chunk-size and --max-chunks
   gives the user the control over chunk size when creating a CISO file.
 - With release v0.37 I have written a complete new function to calculate the
   WBFS geometry (outsourcing of the calculation so that other commands can use
   the results). Up to now the new and the old calculation have been compared
   on every WBFS formatting. From now only this new calculation is used.
 - wit DUMP --long: Print content of TICKET and TMD too.
 - New option for wit DUMP: --show=keylist: This option allows fine control
   over the things that should be printed. If set --long is ignored. Allowed
   keywords: NONE, ALL, INTRO, P-TAB, P-INFO, P-MAP, D-MAP, TICKET, TMD,
   PART (=P-INFO|P-MAP|TICKET|TMD), MAP (=P-MAP|D-MAP).
   If --show is set option --long is ignored.
 - wit+wwt VERIFY --long --long: Hex dump of 'DATA' was wrong.
 - Bug fix for option --pmode: keyword INDEX is enabled now.
 - New warnings (exit status): "Nothing to do" and "No source file found".

wit v1.01b r1248 - 2010-06-20

 - Bug fix for "wit DUMP":
    - If neither --show nor --long is set the head parameters was not printed.
    - Indention was wrong.

wit v@.@@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Bug fix for "wit COPY": If converting an ISO to a plain iso file (*.iso) in
   scrubbing mode the destination file was truncated to the needed size. Now
   it is extended to 4 699 979 776 bytes again.

Missing docu:

 - wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT
 - Option --show
