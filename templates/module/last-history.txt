wwt v0.44a r973 - 2010-05-02

  - wit bug fix: Option --enc was not accepted.
  - ISO composing supports now UPDATE, DATA and CHANNEL (new!) partitions.
  - wit DIFF: If option --files= (-F) is set then the ISO images (real or
    virtual FST) will be compared on file level. The option --files= declares
    a file filter.
  - Progress counter for "wit EXTRACT" enabled.
  - Option --files= (-F): The macros are redifined as positive list.
    Now we have the following macros:
    =base =nobase =disc =nodisc =sys =nosys =files =nofiles =wit =wwt =sneek
  - wit COPY can decrypt or encrypt ISO images on the fly when copying in
    scrubbed mode. This does not change the signature.
  - Fix some troubles with new cyygwin release 1.7.5-1. The main problem
    was file path creation with absolute path names.

  - To avoid troubles with platform dependent openssl support I have integrated
    the SHA1 sources from openssl into WWT.
  - The new command "wit VERIFY" checks the hash signatures of all needed
    sectors (keyword "scrubbed"). All five hash levels (H0..H4) are verified.
    This means 64 decryptions and 1024 SHA1 calculations for each MiB.

Missing docu:
  - docu of wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT + VERIFY
  - docu of "wit COPY --fst" => "wit EXTRACT"
  - docu of options --pmode= --sneek --fst --ignore-fst --logging (-L) --enc=
