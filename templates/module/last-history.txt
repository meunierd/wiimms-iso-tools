wwt v0.45a r1012 - 2010-05-05

  - To avoid troubles with platform dependent openssl support I have integrated
    the SHA1 sources from openssl into WWT.
  - The new command "wit VERIFY" checks the hash signatures of all needed
    sectors (keyword "scrubbed"). All five hash levels (H0..H4) are verified.
    This means 64 AES decryptions and 1029 SHA1 calculations for each MiB.

  - The main name have changed from "Wiimms WBFS Tool" to "Wiimms ISO Tools".
    The following things are changed too:
     - '/usr/local/share/wwt/' moved to '/usr/local/share/wit/'
     - Environment variable WWT_LANG moved to WIT_LANG.
  - wwt INIT --recover: recover also previous deleted files. Discs with
    collisions (use blocks that other discs also use) are never recovered.
  - New command: wwt RECOVER: Works like "wwt INIT --recover", but only with
    already WBFS formatted files => not formatting, only recovering.
    "wwt RECOVER" can be used with the option --test to see what happen.
  - wit VERIFY: Output messages redesigned. Verbosity can be controlled in
    five levels from -qq up to -vv.
  - The new option --limit sets a limit for VERIFY error messages.
  - New command: wwt VERIFY: works like "wit VERIFY" but with wwt interface.
    It also supports options --remove and --no-free for removing or dropping
    invalid discs.
  - Docu of wit+wwt VERIFY and "wwt RECOVER" added.
  - Minor bug fix for wwt CHECK: It have shown 'free blocks' errors for some
    removed discs if this the discs removed with a non wwt tool.
  - CGYWIN release: The new batch file 'run-cmd-as-admin.bat' starts a cmd
    window in administrator mode. This should simplify the work with wwt.

Missing docu:
  - docu of wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT
  - docu of "wit COPY --fst" => "wit EXTRACT"
  - docu of options --pmode= --sneek --fst --ignore-fst --logging (-L) --enc=
