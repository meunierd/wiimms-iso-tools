wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - New option: wit --force: Ignore partition size errors and allow access to
   damaged partitions. "wwt --force" works similar.
 - New options: --disc-id=id, --boot-id=id, --ticket-id=id, --tmd-id=id and
   --wbfs-id=id: Patch only the specific ID. These options are handled after
   the --id and --modify options. pathcing the WBFS ID while adding a game is
   now also possible.
 - New implementation of command "wit ID6": It generates an ID6 list of all
   sources. This is similar as before, only the meaning of the parameters
   changed. If option --long is set, a table with 5 IDs (DISC, BOOT, TICKET,
   TMD and WBFS) is printed. BOOT, TICKET and TMD IDs are taken from the main
   partition. If --long is set twice, all IDs of all partitions are printed.
 - wwt LLLL: List contains date and time (in seconds) columns.
