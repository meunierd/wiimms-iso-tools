wit v@.@@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Because I finished my work with wwt (the WBFS manager) it's time to
   declare Version 1.00. The tool wit is still under development.
 - This is the last version which supports the three tools iso2wbfs, iso2wdf
   and wdf2iso. Use the more powerful command 'wit copy' instead.
 - Makefile changes:
    - File './include-local' is not included anymore. Instead the file
      'makefiles-local/Makefile.local.$(SYSTEM)' is included.
    - make chmod: change mode 775/644 for known dirs and files.
    - make chown: change owner of all dirs+files to owner of '.'.
    - make chgrp: change group of all dirs+files to group of '.'.
    - make ch+  := make chmod chown chgrp
 - wit DUMP: Output improved.
 - wit DUMP can now dump data structure of Wii ISO files, ticket.bin (new!),
   tmd.bin (new!), header.bin (new!), boot.bin, fst.bin and of DOL-files.
   The file type is detected automatically by analyzing the content.

Missing docu:
 - wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT
