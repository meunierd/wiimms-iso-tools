wit v1.00a r1214 - 2010-06-12

 - Because I finished my work with wwt (the WBFS manager) it's time to
   declare Version 1.00. The tool wit is still under development.
 - This is the last version which supports the three tools iso2wbfs, iso2wdf
   and wdf2iso. Use the more powerful command 'wit copy' instead.
 - Makefile changes:
    - File './include-local' is not included anymore. Instead the file
      'makefiles-local/Makefile.local.$(SYSTEM)' is included.
    - make chmod: change mode 775/644 for known dirs and files.
    - make chown: change owner of all dirs+files to owner of '.'.
    - make chgrp: change group of all dirs+files to group of '.'.
    - make ch+  := make chmod chown chgrp
 - wit DUMP: Output improved.
 - wit DUMP can now dump data structure of Wii ISO files, ticket.bin (new!),
   tmd.bin (new!), header.bin (new!), boot.bin, fst.bin and of DOL-files.
   The file type is detected automatically by analyzing the content.

wit v1.00b r1218 - 2010-06-12  (repository only)

 - The tools iso2wbfs, iso2wdf and wdf2iso have been removed. Use wit instead.

 - CISO support: The new options --chunk-mode, --chunk-size and --max-chunks
   gives the user the control over chunk size when creating a CISO file.
 - With release v0.37 I have written a complete new function to calculate the
   WBFS geometry (outsourcing of the calculation so that other commands can use
   the results). Up to now the new and the old calculation have been compared
   on every WBFS formatting. From now only this new calculation is used.
 - wit DUMP --long: Print content of TICKET and TMD too.
 - New option for wit DUMP: --show=keylist: This option allows fine control
   over the things that should be printed. If set --long is ignored. Allowed
   keywords: NONE, ALL, INTRO, P-TAB, P-INFO, P-MAP, D-MAP, TICKET, TMD,
   PART (=P-INFO|P-MAP|TICKET|TMD), MAP (=P-MAP|D-MAP).
   If --show is set option --long is ignored.
 - wit+wwt VERIFY --long --long: Hex dump of 'DATA' was wrong.
 - Bug fix for option --pmode: keyword INDEX is enabled now.
 - New warnings (exit status): "Nothing to do" and "No source file found".

To do:

 - Error code for: No source found

Missing docu:

 - wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT
