wit v0.46a r1043 - 2010-05-13

  - The main name have changed from "Wiimms WBFS Tool" to "Wiimms ISO Tools".
    The following things are changed too:
     - '/usr/local/share/wwt/' moved to '/usr/local/share/wit/'
     - Environment variable WWT_LANG moved to WIT_LANG.
  - wwt INIT --recover: recover also previous deleted files. Discs with
    collisions (use blocks that other discs also use) are never recovered.
  - New command: wwt RECOVER: Works like "wwt INIT --recover", but only with
    already WBFS formatted files => not formatting, only recovering.
    "wwt RECOVER" can be used with the option --test to see what happen.
  - wit VERIFY: Output messages redesigned. Verbosity can be controlled in
    five levels from -qq up to -vv.
  - The new option --limit sets a limit for VERIFY error messages.
  - New command: wwt VERIFY: works like "wit VERIFY" but with wwt interface.
    It also supports options --remove and --no-free for removing or dropping
    invalid discs.
  - Docu of wit+wwt VERIFY and "wwt RECOVER" added.
  - Minor bug fix for wwt CHECK: It have shown 'free blocks' errors for some
    removed discs if this the discs removed with a non wwt tool.
  - CGYWIN release: The new batch file 'run-cmd-as-admin.bat' starts a cmd
    window in administrator mode. This should simplify the work with wwt.

  - ID checking redesigned, underscore is now an allowed character.
  - Command line parsing rewritten: Commands and command specific options are
    defined in a special tool (C file 'gen-ui.c'). If running this tool it
    generates C source for all tools to analyse commands and options and to
    print help messages.
  - Included help was improved: wit and wwt supports now 'HELP command'.
    The output is now aligned to the current terminal width.
  - The documentation of all new options is now complete.
  - Bug fix: wit has shown wrong file size for splitted ISO images.

Missing docu:
  - wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT
